            <h2>Community Science Museum</h2>
            <p>
                Webdesign for an interactive science museum called Community Science Museum. Its core target audience is primary and middle school children (7-15) and families with young children. The museum wanted a website that was informative and appealing, that will attract both middle school pupils and their parents. The site should appeal to youngsters without pandering; it should take for granted that the audience is inquisitive and intelligent. The website should be informative and engaging, but should encourage viewers to visit the museum itself.
